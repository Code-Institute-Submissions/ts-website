      <h1>What format is your CV in?</h1>

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>Back in the day before personal computers and widespread adoption of email as a means of communication, applying for a job involved typing an up-to-date CV and cover letter on a typewriter, fixing typos with Typex/Whiteout [other brands are available ;) ], getting them photocopied, putting them in an envelope and sending them to your prospective employer via the postal service.</p>

      <p>Then came word-processors, which were basically souped up typewriters which could store data and display characters input on a tiny screen, thus allowing correction prior to printing, and in the more advanced models, storage and retrieval of entire pages or documents.   This certainly made things a bit easier, but ultimately you still ended up with sheets of paper which had to be mailed.</p>

      <h2>The Modern Way</h2>

      <p>Nowadays, of course, almost all job applications are made by email or through the web.   Some employers merely ask you to email them your CV, others require you to complete a web form, inputting all your details in the format prescribed by the employer.   And any company big enough to have a Human Resources department will undoubtedly use automated tools designed to extract and parse the relevant data and use algorithms to decide who's a good fit for the job.   Your CV may not even be viewed by a human:  it may be rejected by an algorithm.</p>

      <p>And, it seems, different incarnations of these tools are better or worse at correctly parsing and decoding different formats.   It has been said to me (though I don't know whether this is actually true) that in general they tend to be better at parsing Microsoft's <code>.doc</code> format than the open standard <code>.pdf</code> format.   But, either way, whether your CV is actually seen by a human might well depend on such factors as exactly what headings you have for your sections, how you categorise your various skills and what format you send it in.</p>

      <p>Of course, applications taken by means of web forms clearly allow these factors to be obviated, which is probably why more and more employers are adopting this method.</p>

      <p>However, this does complicate things for jobseekers, as not only do you have to have a CV prepared as a pdf file, for example, but then you have to do a lot of copy/paste operations to get it into an employer's web form.   And every employer's form is different!</p>

      <h2>A New Idea</h2>

      <p>What would greatly facilitate job applications, then, would be the adoption of a standard format for CVs, which would have defined fields that could be parsed by a simple online or offline application.   To me, the obvious choice would be a JSON schema, but an XML schema would also serve the purpose; I just prefer JSON, partly because it's just natively compatible with Javascript, but also because I like curly brackets better than angle brackets!</p>

      <p>Such a schema would have named fields from which any employer could parse an applicant's details with exactitude.   So, for example, the beginning of a JSON CV might look something like this:</p>

      <pre><code class="code-boxed">
      {
        "info": {
            "name": "Alice Foo",
            "email": "alicef@bar.net",
            "tel": "+555(0)555-5555",
            "website": "http://www.alicefoo.net",
            "github": "https://github.com/alicefoo",
            "address": {
              "address-0": "Apartment 42",
              "address-1": "Heart of Gold",
              "address-2": "Ballydehob",
              "region": "Co. Cork",
              "country": "IE"
            }
        },
        "work-current": {
            "employer": {
              ...
            }
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>I'd be interested to hear the reactions both of employees and of employers to such a proposal... </p>
