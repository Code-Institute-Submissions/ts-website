			About me
		</h1>
		<p>
			Hi.   I'm John Lynch.   I love coding, playing with mathematics, and using both of these to create digital art.   I also love playing music (piano, sax, tin whistles), growing vegetables, trees and even a few flowers; cooking and making chutneys, marmalades etc.; and enjoying good coffee, preferably freshly-ground and ideally not long roasted!
		</p>
		<p>
			Back in the day, I did a mathematics degree at Hull University, since which I've worked with computers for many years in a variety of roles, mostly involving operations and technical support, as well as running a PC factory, but over the past few years my early passion for coding has, delightfully, returned.   And I've been using it, and my mathematical knowledge, to create digital art, mainly using Java and Clojure, but lately also in GLSL, directly programming the GPU.
		</p>
		<p>   All this stuff is quite specialised, though, so in January 2018 I enrolled on a <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.codeinstitute.net/program/FullstackWebDeveloper">Code Institute course</a> to learn all the technologies required to develop both the front- and back-ends of websites and web applications, and to understand all the necessary wiring that serves to knit all these technologies together.</p>
		<p> These days I'm living in the wild hills of West Cork, Ireland, but over the years have worked in various parts of the UK, Ireland, Australia, Spain, Italy and Thailand.  
		</p>

			If you need a website, would like help with creating one yourself; if you'd like to learn how to program your computer; or if you'd like a talk for your organisation about fractals and digital art, together with live projected fractal images, videos and animations, please contact me at the (obfuscated) address:

		<h1 class = "intro" id="about-this-website">About this website</h1>
<p>This website was lovingly crafted by hand, using raw semantic HTML5 and CSS3.  It has formed the substance of the first &quot;milestone project&quot; I have had to complete as part of my studies on the <a href="https://www.codeinstitute.net/mentored-online/">Full-stack Developer course at Code Institute in Dublin</a>.</p>
<p>I did not use any preprocessors like Sass or HAML, as I felt I first needed to learn the nuts and bolts, particularly of CSS.   The only external resources used are Google Fonts (for <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali">Mali</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik">Rubik</a>), Font Awesome for social media icons, and embedded iframes from Youtube and Shadertoy.</p>
<p>All the images are mine.   The photographs were taken with my Nikon Coolpix P500 digital SLR camera, and the fractal images were generated by a Java escape-time fractal program which I have been developing over the past couple of years.   I use <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to resize them where necessary, or occasionally <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.</p>
<p>I write the articles in Markdown, use a web service like <a href="https://markdowntohtml.com/">https://markdowntohtml.com/</a> to convert to HTML, then edit the HTML if necessary.</p>
<p>I have availed of many resources around the web to help me learn.   The following is far from a complete list, but it covers those which were most important for me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5656369/john">Stack Overflow</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS_TRICKS</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew&#39;s tutorials</a>, and in particular her</li>
<li><a href="https://gridbyexample.com/">CSS Grid tutorial series</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://wesbos.com/javascript30/">Wes Bos&#39;s Javascript 30 tutorial series</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/tag/css">Scott Tolinkski&#39;s CSS tutorials</a> </li>
<li>The code-institute-room at <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, </li>
<li>and finally, on old-fashioned paper, a very good 1080-page book by David flanagan, called &quot;Javascript: The Definitive Guide&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use a quad-core Asus laptop with 8GB RAM, running Xubuntu 18.04 for all my development.</p>
